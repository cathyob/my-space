# Hi!

### My name is Cathy and I'm a web developer based out of the Boston area!

This is a playful version of my main <a href="https://www.obrien.dev/" target="_blank">portfolio site</a> inspired and styled as if it was a MySpace profile page circa 2006 or so!

Using Javascript I've added two features:
<ul>
  <li>I've added a play button fixed to the lower right corner of the browser that you can click to play a random song from a playlist I saved. Pausing/stopping a song will let another random song play the next time you click the button!</li>
  <li>I also added a "last login" date which calculates today's date.</li>
</ul>

#### Check out my story and contact me on my main portfolio <a href="https://www.obrien.dev/" target="_blank">here</a>!
